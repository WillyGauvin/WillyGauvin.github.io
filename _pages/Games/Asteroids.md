# Summary of Contributions:

I created all mechanics, UI, and controls in the game.  

I developed collision detection and reaction for all asteroids and bullets.  

I implemented object pooling (a game programming concept that allows the reuse of common unused objects instead of its expensive alternative of creating new ones) for bullets and asteroids.
