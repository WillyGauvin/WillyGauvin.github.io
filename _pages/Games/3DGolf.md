# Summary of Contributions:

I learned to create a lighting shader. This shader is able to calculate **specular** (relfection off a smooth surface, like a mirror) and **diffuse** reflections (when light reflects off a rough surface and shines in all directions, like a reflector on the back of a bicycle) as well as **attenuation** (light fades the further it is from the source) all based on the position of the camera in scene.
