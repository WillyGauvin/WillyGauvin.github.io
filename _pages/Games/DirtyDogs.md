# Summary of Contributions:

I challenged myself by taking on development of an Online Multiplayer game for the first time. I had to learn how to develop using standard Server-Client architecture through proper replication. I hosted this on a dedicated server through Steam.

I was responsible for creating all gameplay controls with additional support for controller gameplay.
