My interest in creating video games started in 2021. I've used multiple engiens to create them such as:

* Unreal Engine 5
* Unity
* Custom Engine (**created by me!**)
* GameDev2D (**Created by one of my professors**)

Here's all the game's I have created since 2021!

## Unreal Engine

### Dirty Dogs

Dirty Dogs is the most recent game I have created using Unreal Engine 5.  
This game was created in 4 months for a Mini-Capstone project that took place during my 4th semester in Game Development.  

In our group of 6, I took on the role of Networking the game.  During this time, I learned how to implement standard Server-Client architecture through proper replication, all hosted on a dedicated server through Steam.  

Countless hours were spent reading [Unreal's Network Compendium][Unreal Network Compendium]{:target="_blank"}!

### Super Mario Remake

This is my Super Mario reamke, my second game I created in Unreal Engine 5!  
I developed this remake independently in around 2 weeks.

Some key features include

* Shooting and Jumping
* Two types of Patrolling NPC Goombas:
  1. Regular Patroller
  2. Shooting Patroller (Player Detection using RayCasts)
* Togglable Blocks
  * Hitting a "Off" block with your head or shooting it toggles the collision boxes of blue blocks.
* Checkpoint flags
* Moving Platforms

### Pong

This was my first time using Unreal Engine. Starting with a 2D game took off a lot of the pressure that three-dimensional physics brings to the table. I spent around a week making this.  

This is a Single Player game. You control the left paddle while the game controls the right.  

For my first time using Unreal Engine 5, it turned out pretty well.

## Unity

### Librarian Simulator

In May of 2024 I took on a personal project and built a librarian simulator in Unity.

I worked independently on the backend of the game, implementing features such as:

* NPC's using Behaviour Tree's  
(A concept I learned while developing my [Roller Derby Game](#roller-derby))
* Interactable and placeable objects
* Inventory system
* Random Events
  * Noisy citizens
  * Book checkout requests
  * Book check in requests

Along with the backend development, I also worked on the front end with help from Sean Nichol; a friend of mine who is majoring in the art side of my college program.
